# PECVD-Graphene-Growth

This project aims to create a method for low temperature Graphene grwoth using plasma assited chemical vapor deposition. The alternative idea is to eliminate the chemical reaction outside the CVD chember for 1.) Reducing the pyrolytic temperature; 2.) Lowering the formation energy for the carbon network. Therefore, dip-coating process was chosen to deposit the carbon precurson (polyimide) directly on the substrate(SiO2/Si or GaN/Sapphire). 

Another goal is to use the grown graphene film as the base layer for the fabrication of hot electron transistor to achieve better electron tunneling effects, then to achieve the ballistic electron movement.

A detailed explanation is in the full report.
